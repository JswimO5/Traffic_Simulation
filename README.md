# Traffic_Simulation
 Models the traffic in Davidson in the area surrounding the Griffith and Main St. intersection.
 Multiple states of the area will be modeled with variations including the current traffic;
 traffic after the implementation of a round about at Griffith, Beaty, and Main;
 traffic after the implementation of a new connection between Sloan and Potts;
 and traffic with both of the new additions included in the simulation.
 Made by James Durcan, Nolan Elder, Jackson McDonald.
 Done in Collaboration with Tim Chartier and Andrew Golden.
